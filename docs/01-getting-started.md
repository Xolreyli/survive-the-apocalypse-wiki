# Getting Started

## Your starting gear
Every player starts with:
- **Bat**
- **Backpack** (10 item slots)

> This is true even if you equip a Class.

## Basic survival loop
1. **Loot crates** and buildings for weapons, ammo, healing, and backpacks
2. **Build/fortify a base** using the Crafting Table
3. Survive waves (difficulty increases over time)
4. Watch for **Supply Crates** and **Blood Moons** (every 5 days)
5. Progress toward **Day 100 Extraction**

## Key tips
- The **Hospital** and **Police Station** have better loot but heavier zombie presence
- **Rain** resets zombies and crates when it ends — use it to re-loot areas
- Crafting scales in cost based on **players in the lobby**, so plan builds early
