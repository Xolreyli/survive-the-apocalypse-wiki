summary: How waves scale in difficulty, how to repair powerplants, and how to successfully extract from the city.
---

## Waves get harder
Each wave/day increases difficulty. Expect:
- more enemies
- more dangerous specials
- **Brutes** appearing later (especially during Blood Moons)

## Extraction (escape)
Extraction allows a player to escape the city.

### How it works
A **helicopter** appears at base and drops a rope.
Stand in the **circle around the rope** to successfully extract.

### Requirements (all required)
- **4/4 Powerplants repaired**
- **1/1 Radio Tower Part**
- **Survive Day 100**

## Powerplants (multiplier system)
Powerplants are yellow “box” structures around the map.

- Each day starts at **1x**
- Repairing a powerplant adds +1x
  - Example: fix 3 powerplants → 1x becomes **4x**
- Fixing **all powerplants** is required to extract

> The doc notes that repairing powerplants (and a 5x effect) can also speed up Blood Moon occurrence.
