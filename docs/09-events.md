# Events

## Supply Crates (every 5 days)
Supply Crates fall from the sky **every 5 days**.

They contain higher-tier loot such as:
- Refined Fuel
- Refined Metal
- Weapons
- Armor
- Bandages / Medkits
- MREs

## Blood Moon
Blood Moon happens every 5 days **right after** a Supply Crate drop (as described in the source).

- Zombie hordes are exponentially harder than normal days
- Brutes can appear during Blood Moons as you survive more days
- The **last zombie** drops a **Zombie Heart**

> The source also notes that a **5x multiplier from repairing Powerplants** can speed up how often Blood Moons occur.

## Weather: Rain
Rain resets the map:
- when rain ends, **all zombies and crates respawn**

## Raiders
Sometimes raiders attack your camp instead of zombies.
- You’ll get on-screen text warning you
- Raiders are non-zombie hostile NPCs
- They use powerful melee weapons (Fire Axe, Sledgehammer) and guns
- They drop ammo
